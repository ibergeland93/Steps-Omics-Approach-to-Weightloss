# Steps Omics Approach to Weightloss

This project uses data from a previously completed clinical trial, which provides a well characterized sample of overweight or obese Filipino individuals, outcomes of a mobile phone-based intervention for weight loss, continuous physical activity data, dietary pattern data, and previously collected gene expression data. This study proposes to develop and assess predictive models for weight loss using demographic, clinical, gene expression, step count, and dietary pattern data and evaluate gene expression levels that are associated with weight loss. The potential impact of this project is improved prediction of which individuals are most likely to lose weight in response to a physical activity and dietary intervention and generation of new knowledge about the mechanisms that underlie weight loss.

Table of Contents: Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

Installation: Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

Usage: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

Contributing: Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.

Credits: Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.

License: Finally, include a section for the license of your project.

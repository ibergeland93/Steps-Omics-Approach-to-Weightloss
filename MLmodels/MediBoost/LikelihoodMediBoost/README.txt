Usage:

    Open the script likelihoodmediboostmain and provide the dataset file DATA.MAT, the 
    depth of the tree DEPTH_LIMIT, the value of the accelerator factor A, the 
    learning rate for the update of the function values of the nodes LEARNINGRATE and

    the categorical predictor vector CATPREDICTORS. Then, in the Command Window type:

		likelihoodmediboostmain

	to run the demonstration script.

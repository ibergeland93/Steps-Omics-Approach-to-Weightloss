MediBoost Decision Trees

==============



Matlab scripts that demonstrate how to build a tree under the MediBoost 
paradigm. For more information please see:

and SOLDBERG Timothy. MediBoost: a Patient Stratification Tool for 
Interpretable Decision Making in the Era of Precision Medicine.

Usage:

    In the Command Window type:

		likelihoodmediboostgui

    to run the demonstration script. Use the sliders to edit the 
    values of DEPTH LIMIT of the tree, the value of the ACCELERATION FACTOR 
    A, and the LEARNING RATE for the update of the function values of the nodes.
    There are two numerical UCI datasets available, namely WINSCONSIN and BREAST
    TISSUE to be selected using the pop-up menu. Press the TRAIN push button to
    build a MediBoost tree.
